<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>
  I am a Research Fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies (MCFS). 
</p>
    
<p>
  MCFS is one of the cross-disciplinary research centres within Monash Business School, Monash University. 
  We execute policy and industry relevant research related to the financial sector.
</p>
  
<p>
  My research areas include finance, macroeconomics and labour economics. 
</p>
    
<p>
  Currently, I am particularly interested in studying banking organisations and their role in the broader economy. 
  I study why banks thrive or fail, how they respond to policies and regulations, and how their behaviour affects the wellbeing of individuals, households and firms. 
  Oftentimes, my research aims to inform public policy decisions. 
</p>
  
<p>
  Prior to joining the Centre in August 2024, I obtained my PhD in Economics from Princeton University.

    <b>Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours</b>
    <br>
    <button class="collapsible"><font size="-1">Abstract.</font></button>
    <div class="abstract">
    <p><font size="-1">This paper explores how frictions in lending relationships affect banks' geographic expansion. Leveraging the US interstate banking deregulation as a natural experiment, I find that banks are indeed more likely to expand to new locations with a stronger presence of "familiar" firms. These firms already operate in the bank's original neighbourhoods. This finding is consistent with bank-firm lending relationships being local and persistent. As a consequence, the statewide deregulation may not benefit all regions and firms equally. Areas where more "familiar" entities experience more entries and higher growth. Small businesses may not benefit as much as large firms. These findings highlight the potential limitations of banking deregulation in generating economic growth and offer policy guidance for more effective and equitable financial reforms.</font></p>

    <b>The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel</b> 
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> Banks play a role in transimitting trade shocks across regions and from tradable to non-tradable sectors. This paper studies the reponse of US banks to increase in import competition in the local economy due to China's accession to WTO. I find that exposed banks experience slower growth in deposits and limit their lending to households, and this further translates into slower employment growth in the local non-tradable sectors.</font>

    <b>Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> This paper studies the effects of government bailouts on banks' survial during the crisis. I find that US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program had a lower failure rate than the non-recipient. However, the rescuing effects dissipate shortly after the peak of the crisis. Meanwhile, capital recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher overall exit rate.</font>

    <b>The Early County Business Pattern Files: 1946–1974</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>(with Fabian Eckert, Atif R. Mian, Karsten Müller, Rafael Schwalb, and Amir Sufi)</i></font>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> The County Business Pattern (CBP) files contain employment and establishment counts for detailed industry codes covering all counties in the United States. The contribution of this project is to digitize, clean, and prepare the CBP files during 1946–1974.</font>

    <b>County Business Patterns 1946–2016: A User Manual</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>(with Fabian Eckert, Atif R. Mian, Karsten Müller, Rafael Schwalb, and Amir Sufi)</i></font>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> This user manual provides a detailed documentation of a database containing all CBP datasets published during the first 70 years since its inception. We digitized historical data from physical print, standardized all data format, and imputed undisclosed employment counts. We also document changes in the data structure, industry classifications and county boundaries. </font>

    <b>Historical Data on Syndicated Loans 1973–1990</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>(with Atif R. Mian, Karsten Müller and Amir Sufi)</i></font>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> We tabulate historical data on syndicated loans published on World Bank "Borrowing in International Capital Markets" and Euromoney magazine. These new data significantly expand the currently available syndicated loan data, and are particularly relevant for research on international banking activities.  </font>

<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

<p><i>At Princeton University, I served as teaching asssitant for the following courses:</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>ECO362 Financial Investments</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Description:</i> This course is an introduction to financial investments for students with no prior knowledge of finance. It provides an overview of financial markets and instruments including stocks, bonds, futures, options, and other derivatives. A theory of optimal asset allocation teaches the tradeoff between risk and return and the importance of diversification. A theory of asset pricing, developed under the assumption of no arbitrage, is used to evaluate trading strategies and the performance of mutual funds and other asset managers. Key concepts are illustrated through examples and homework exercises that use financial market data.</font>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>ECO363 Corporate Finance and Financial Institutions</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Description:</i> This course examines the determinants of corporate financing decisions and the role of financial institutions in the wider context of the working of financial markets. Topics include capital budgeting, capital structure, risk management, and corporate governance. Additionally, the course introduces various methodologies for valuing individual projects, as well as entire companies.</font>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <b>FIN502 Corporate Finance and Financial Accounting</b>
    <br>
    <font size="-1"><i>Description:</i> Major topics in modern corporate finance. We study investment policy (investment decision rules, project valuation, cost of capital) and financial policy (mostly capital structure decisions). Additional topics (private equity, bankruptcy and reorganization, merger and acquisitions) are covered if time permits.</font>
  </li>
</ul>
