<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I am a Research Fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies, Monash Business School, Monash University.</p>

<p>My research fields include finance, macroeconomics and labour economics. 
  Currently, I am particularly interested in studying banking organisations. 
  My research helps improve our understanding of the role banks play in our broad economy, 
  by studying why they thrive or fail, 
  how they respond to policies and regulations, 
  and how they impact the wellbeing of individuals, households and firms. 
  Meanwhile, my research aims to inform policy decisions and industry practices. </p>

<p>Prior to joining the Centre, I obtained my PhD in Economics from Princeton University. </p>
