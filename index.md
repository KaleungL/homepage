<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I am a Research Fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies, Monash Business School, Monash University.</p>

<p>My research areas include finance, macroeconomics and labour economics. </p>
  
<p>Currently, I am particularly interested in studying banking organisations and their role in the broader economy. 
  I study why banks thrive or fail, 
  how they respond to policies and regulations, 
  and how their behaviour affects the wellbeing of individuals, households and firms. 
  Oftentimes, my research aims to inform policy decisions or industry practices. </p>

<p>Prior to joining the Centre in August 2024, I obtained my PhD in Economics from Princeton University. </p>

  <b>Banks' Geographic Expansion: New Location, Same Old Neighbours</b>
  <p margin-left="40px"><font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> This paper explores how frictions in lending relationships affect banks' geographic expansion. Leveraging the US interstate banking deregulation as a natural experiment, I find that banks are indeed more likely to expand to new locations with a stronger presence of "familiar" firms. These firms already operate in the bank's original neighbourhoods. This finding is consistent with bank-firm lending relationships being local and persistent. As a consequence, the statewide deregulation may not benefit all regions and firms equally. Areas where more "familiar" entities experience more entries and higher growth. Small businesses may not benefit as much as large firms. These findings highlight the potential limitations of banking deregulation in generating economic growth and offer policy guidance for more effective and equitable financial reforms.</font></p>

1. <b>The Financial Transmission of Trade Shocks: Household Credit Channel</b>
<p margin-left="40px"><font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> Banks play a role in transimitting trade shocks across regions and from tradable to non-tradable sectors. This paper studies the reponse of US banks to increase in import competition in the local economy due to China's accession to WTO. I find that exposed banks experience slower growth in deposits and limit their lending to households, and this further translates into slower employment growth in the local non-tradable sectors.</font></p> <br>

1. <b>Capital Injection: Live Long and Wither</b>
<p margin-left="40px"><font size="-1"><i>Abstract.</i> This paper studies the effects of government bailouts on banks' survial during the crisis. I find that US banks who received capital injections from the Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program had a lower failure rate than the non-recipient. However, the rescuing effects dissipate shortly after the peak of the crisis. Meanwhile, capital recipients also had a substantially higher chance of being acquired, possibly due to political pressures and management inefficiency, resulting in a higher overall exit rate.</font></p>  <br>
