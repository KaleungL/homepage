<h1>Hello!</h1>

<p>I am a Research Fellow at Monash Centre for Financial Studies, Monash Business School, Monash University.</p>

<p>My research areas include finance, macroeconomics and labour economics. </p>
  
<p>Currently, I am particularly interested in studying banking organisations and their role in the broader economy, 
  I study why banks thrive or fail, 
  how they respond to policies and regulations, 
  and how their behaviour affects the wellbeing of individuals, households and firms. 
  Oftentimes, my research aims to inform policy decisions or industry practices. </p>

<p>Prior to joining the Centre in August 2024, I obtained my PhD in Economics from Princeton University. </p>
